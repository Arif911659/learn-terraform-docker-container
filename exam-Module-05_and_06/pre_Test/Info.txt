Create k3s cluster in private subnet and nginx load balancer in public subnet using terraform blueprint approach.

To set up a k3s cluster in a private subnet and an Nginx load balancer in a public subnet using the Terraform blueprint approach, you'll need to create resources in the following manner:
VPC Configuration: Create a VPC with public and private subnets.
Security Groups: Create appropriate security groups for the k3s cluster and the Nginx load balancer.
EC2 Instances: Launch EC2 instances in the private subnet for the k3s cluster (master and worker nodes) and an EC2 instance in the public subnet for the Nginx load balancer.
k3s Setup: Configure the k3s cluster on the private subnet EC2 instances.
Nginx Load Balancer: Set up Nginx on the public EC2 instance to forward traffic to the k3s cluster.
Here is a Terraform blueprint approach:
Step 1: Define the Provider
hcl
Copy code
provider "aws" {
  region = "us-west-2"
}

Step 2: Create VPC, Subnets, and Security Groups
hcl
Copy code
resource "aws_vpc" "main" {
  cidr_block = "10.0.0.0/16"
}

resource "aws_subnet" "public" {
  vpc_id            = aws_vpc.main.id
  cidr_block        = "10.0.1.0/24"
  map_public_ip_on_launch = true
}

resource "aws_subnet" "private" {
  vpc_id     = aws_vpc.main.id
  cidr_block = "10.0.2.0/24"
}

resource "aws_internet_gateway" "gw" {
  vpc_id = aws_vpc.main.id
}

resource "aws_route_table" "public_rt" {
  vpc_id = aws_vpc.main.id
}

resource "aws_route" "internet_access" {
  route_table_id         = aws_route_table.public_rt.id
  destination_cidr_block = "0.0.0.0/0"
  gateway_id             = aws_internet_gateway.gw.id
}

resource "aws_route_table_association" "public_assoc" {
  subnet_id      = aws_subnet.public.id
  route_table_id = aws_route_table.public_rt.id
}

resource "aws_security_group" "nginx_lb_sg" {
  name        = "nginx_lb_sg"
  vpc_id      = aws_vpc.main.id

  ingress {
    from_port   = 80
    to_port     = 80
    protocol    = "tcp"
    cidr_blocks = ["0.0.0.0/0"]
  }

  egress {
    from_port   = 0
    to_port     = 0
    protocol    = "-1"
    cidr_blocks = ["0.0.0.0/0"]
  }
}

resource "aws_security_group" "k3s_cluster_sg" {
  name        = "k3s_cluster_sg"
  vpc_id      = aws_vpc.main.id

  ingress {
    from_port   = 6443
    to_port     = 6443
    protocol    = "tcp"
    cidr_blocks = ["10.0.0.0/16"]
  }

  ingress {
    from_port   = 22
    to_port     = 22
    protocol    = "tcp"
    cidr_blocks = ["0.0.0.0/0"]
  }

  egress {
    from_port   = 0
    to_port     = 0
    protocol    = "-1"
    cidr_blocks = ["0.0.0.0/0"]
  }
}

Step 3: Create EC2 Instances for k3s Cluster (Master and Worker Nodes)
hcl
Copy code
resource "aws_instance" "k3s_master" {
  ami           = "ami-0c55b159cbfafe1f0" # Replace with Ubuntu AMI
  instance_type = "t3.medium"
  subnet_id     = aws_subnet.private.id
  security_groups = [aws_security_group.k3s_cluster_sg.id]

  tags = {
    Name = "k3s-master"
  }

  user_data = <<-EOF
    #!/bin/bash
    curl -sfL https://get.k3s.io | sh -s - server --node-ip=10.0.2.10
  EOF
}

resource "aws_instance" "k3s_worker" {
  count         = 2
  ami           = "ami-0c55b159cbfafe1f0" # Replace with Ubuntu AMI
  instance_type = "t3.medium"
  subnet_id     = aws_subnet.private.id
  security_groups = [aws_security_group.k3s_cluster_sg.id]

  tags = {
    Name = "k3s-worker-${count.index + 1}"
  }

  user_data = <<-EOF
    #!/bin/bash
    curl -sfL https://get.k3s.io | K3S_URL=https://10.0.2.10:6443 K3S_TOKEN=<your_token> sh -
  EOF
}

Step 4: Create EC2 Instance for Nginx Load Balancer in Public Subnet
hcl
Copy code
resource "aws_instance" "nginx_lb" {
  ami           = "ami-0c55b159cbfafe1f0" # Replace with Ubuntu AMI
  instance_type = "t2.micro"
  subnet_id     = aws_subnet.public.id
  security_groups = [aws_security_group.nginx_lb_sg.id]

  tags = {
    Name = "nginx-lb"
  }

  user_data = <<-EOF
    #!/bin/bash
    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install -y nginx
    sudo tee /etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf <<EOL
    upstream k3s_cluster {
      server 10.0.2.10:80;
      server 10.0.2.11:80;
      server 10.0.2.12:80;
    }
    server {
      listen 80;
      location / {
        proxy_pass http://k3s_cluster;
      }
    }
    EOL
    sudo systemctl restart nginx
  EOF
}

Step 5: Outputs (Optional)
hcl
Copy code
output "nginx_lb_public_ip" {
  value = aws_instance.nginx_lb.public_ip
}

output "k3s_master_private_ip" {
  value = aws_instance.k3s_master.private_ip
}

output "k3s_worker_private_ips" {
  value = aws_instance.k3s_worker.*.private_ip
}

Explanation:
VPC: A virtual private cloud with public and private subnets.
Security Groups: One for the Nginx load balancer, allowing HTTP traffic, and one for the k3s cluster allowing internal communication.
EC2 Instances: The Nginx load balancer resides in the public subnet, while the k3s master and worker nodes reside in the private subnet.
User Data: Installs k3s on the private instances and Nginx on the public instance, which forwards traffic to the k3s nodes.
This blueprint sets up a basic k3s cluster with Nginx as the load balancer. Make sure to replace <your_token> with the actual token generated by the master node during the k3s setup.

Explain every step in depth

Let’s break down each step in the Terraform blueprint, so you understand how every part fits together to create a k3s cluster in a private subnet and an Nginx load balancer in a public subnet.

Step 1: Define the Provider
hcl
Copy code
provider "aws" {
  region = "us-west-2"
}

Explanation:
Provider: This specifies which cloud provider (AWS in this case) Terraform will communicate with to provision resources.
Region: us-west-2 is the specific region where all AWS resources (VPC, EC2, etc.) will be deployed. You can adjust this to suit your requirements.

Step 2: Create VPC, Subnets, and Security Groups
1. Create the VPC:
hcl
Copy code
resource "aws_vpc" "main" {
  cidr_block = "10.0.0.0/16"
}

VPC: A Virtual Private Cloud is a logically isolated network on AWS where all your resources (EC2, subnets, etc.) will be deployed.
CIDR Block: The VPC is created with the address range 10.0.0.0/16. This means the VPC can have up to 65,536 IP addresses (2^(32-16)).
2. Create the Public Subnet:
hcl
Copy code
resource "aws_subnet" "public" {
  vpc_id                  = aws_vpc.main.id
  cidr_block              = "10.0.1.0/24"
  map_public_ip_on_launch = true
}

Subnet: This defines a network segment inside the VPC. The public subnet has a CIDR block of 10.0.1.0/24, allowing for up to 256 IP addresses.
map_public_ip_on_launch: This ensures that instances launched into this subnet will have public IP addresses assigned, making them accessible from the internet.
3. Create the Private Subnet:
hcl
Copy code
resource "aws_subnet" "private" {
  vpc_id     = aws_vpc.main.id
  cidr_block = "10.0.2.0/24"
}

Private Subnet: This subnet has a CIDR block of 10.0.2.0/24, which is for the k3s cluster. Instances launched here won't have public IP addresses, keeping them isolated from the internet.
4. Create the Internet Gateway:
hcl
Copy code
resource "aws_internet_gateway" "gw" {
  vpc_id = aws_vpc.main.id
}

Internet Gateway: This allows instances in the public subnet to connect to the internet.
5. Create the Route Table for the Public Subnet:
hcl
Copy code
resource "aws_route_table" "public_rt" {
  vpc_id = aws_vpc.main.id
}

Route Table: A route table dictates how traffic should be directed within the VPC. This one is associated with the public subnet.
6. Define a Route for Internet Access:
hcl
Copy code
resource "aws_route" "internet_access" {
  route_table_id         = aws_route_table.public_rt.id
  destination_cidr_block = "0.0.0.0/0"
  gateway_id             = aws_internet_gateway.gw.id
}

Route: The route directs all traffic (0.0.0.0/0 means all traffic) from the public subnet to the internet through the Internet Gateway.
7. Associate the Route Table with the Public Subnet:
hcl
Copy code
resource "aws_route_table_association" "public_assoc" {
  subnet_id      = aws_subnet.public.id
  route_table_id = aws_route_table.public_rt.id
}

Route Table Association: This explicitly links the route table to the public subnet, so all traffic in that subnet follows the rules of the route table (internet access).
8. Create Security Groups:
Nginx Load Balancer Security Group:
hcl
Copy code
resource "aws_security_group" "nginx_lb_sg" {
  name        = "nginx_lb_sg"
  vpc_id      = aws_vpc.main.id

  ingress {
    from_port   = 80
    to_port     = 80
    protocol    = "tcp"
    cidr_blocks = ["0.0.0.0/0"]
  }

  egress {
    from_port   = 0
    to_port     = 0
    protocol    = "-1"
    cidr_blocks = ["0.0.0.0/0"]
  }
}

Ingress Rule: Allows incoming HTTP traffic (port 80) from anywhere (0.0.0.0/0).
Egress Rule: Allows outbound traffic to any destination (0.0.0.0/0).
k3s Cluster Security Group:
hcl
Copy code
resource "aws_security_group" "k3s_cluster_sg" {
  name        = "k3s_cluster_sg"
  vpc_id      = aws_vpc.main.id

  ingress {
    from_port   = 6443
    to_port     = 6443
    protocol    = "tcp"
    cidr_blocks = ["10.0.0.0/16"]
  }

  ingress {
    from_port   = 22
    to_port     = 22
    protocol    = "tcp"
    cidr_blocks = ["0.0.0.0/0"]
  }

  egress {
    from_port   = 0
    to_port     = 0
    protocol    = "-1"
    cidr_blocks = ["0.0.0.0/0"]
  }
}

Ingress Rule (6443): Allows communication between k3s master and worker nodes (k3s API runs on port 6443), limited to the VPC CIDR range (10.0.0.0/16).
Ingress Rule (22): Allows SSH access from anywhere.
Egress Rule: Allows outbound traffic to any destination.

Step 3: Create EC2 Instances for k3s Cluster (Master and Worker Nodes)
1. Master Node:
hcl
Copy code
resource "aws_instance" "k3s_master" {
  ami           = "ami-0c55b159cbfafe1f0" # Replace with Ubuntu AMI
  instance_type = "t3.medium"
  subnet_id     = aws_subnet.private.id
  security_groups = [aws_security_group.k3s_cluster_sg.id]

  tags = {
    Name = "k3s-master"
  }

  user_data = <<-EOF
    #!/bin/bash
    curl -sfL https://get.k3s.io | sh -s - server --node-ip=10.0.2.10
  EOF
}

AMI: Use an Ubuntu AMI. t3.medium is a moderate-sized instance, suitable for running k3s master.
Subnet: The master node is placed in the private subnet (aws_subnet.private.id), making it inaccessible directly from the internet.
Security Group: The master node uses the k3s_cluster_sg security group.
User Data: This script runs when the instance starts. It installs and configures k3s, specifying the master’s IP address (10.0.2.10).
2. Worker Nodes:
hcl
Copy code
resource "aws_instance" "k3s_worker" {
  count         = 2
  ami           = "ami-0c55b159cbfafe1f0" # Replace with Ubuntu AMI
  instance_type = "t3.medium"
  subnet_id     = aws_subnet.private.id
  security_groups = [aws_security_group.k3s_cluster_sg.id]

  tags = {
    Name = "k3s-worker-${count.index + 1}"
  }

  user_data = <<-EOF
    #!/bin/bash
    curl -sfL https://get.k3s.io | K3S_URL=https://10.0.2.10:6443 K3S_TOKEN=<your_token> sh -
  EOF
}

Worker Nodes: Two worker nodes are created using the count argument. Each worker node is launched in the private subnet with t3.medium instances.
User Data: The worker nodes connect to the k3s master node using its IP (10.0.2.10:6443) and the token generated by the master (K3S_TOKEN=<your_token>).

Step 4: Create EC2 Instance for Nginx Load Balancer in Public Subnet
hcl
Copy code
resource "aws_instance" "nginx_lb" {
  ami           = "ami-0c55b159cbfafe1f0" # Replace with Ubuntu AMI
  instance_type = "t2.micro"
  subnet_id     = aws_subnet.public.id
  security_groups = [aws_security_group.nginx_lb_sg.id]

  tags = {
    Name = "nginx-lb"
  }

  user_data = <<-EOF
    #!/bin/bash
    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install -y nginx
    sudo tee /etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf <<EOL
    upstream k3s_cluster {
      server 10.0.2.10:80;
      server 10.0.2.11:80;
      server 10.0.2.12:80;
    }
    server {
      listen 80;
      location / {
        proxy_pass http://k3s_cluster;
      }
    }
    EOL
    sudo systemctl restart nginx
  EOF
}

Nginx Load Balancer: A single EC2 instance (t2.micro) is launched in the public subnet to act as the load balancer.
User Data: Nginx is installed and configured to act as a reverse proxy that distributes traffic between the k3s cluster nodes (10.0.2.10, 10.0.2.11, 10.0.2.12). When traffic comes to the load balancer, it will forward it to one of the k3s nodes.

Step 5: Outputs (Optional)
hcl
Copy code
output "nginx_lb_public_ip" {
  value = aws_instance.nginx_lb.public_ip
}

output "k3s_master_private_ip" {
  value = aws_instance.k3s_master.private_ip
}

output "k3s_worker_private_ips" {
  value = aws_instance.k3s_worker.*.private_ip
}

Outputs: These are useful for getting the public IP of the load balancer and the private IPs of the k3s master and worker nodes.

Summary of Key Concepts:
VPC and Subnets: The public subnet hosts the load balancer (Nginx), while the private subnet hosts the k3s master and worker nodes.
Security Groups: Define what traffic is allowed into/out of the Nginx load balancer and the k3s cluster.
k3s Cluster: A lightweight Kubernetes distribution running in a private subnet.
Nginx Load Balancer: Balances traffic across k3s worker nodes, and it is the only public-facing component.
This setup ensures that your k3s cluster remains secure and isolated, while the Nginx load balancer serves as the entry point for external traffic.

==================================================
now make output for Token of k3s-master
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
To output the K3S_TOKEN from the k3s master in your Terraform configuration, you can use the remote-exec provisioner to retrieve the token from the master node after it is created. The output can then be captured using terraform output.

Step-by-Step Guide to Capture and Output K3S Token
Add the remote-exec Provisioner to the k3s Master Instance:

The remote-exec provisioner will SSH into the master node and run a command to retrieve the token. The token is stored in /var/lib/rancher/k3s/server/node-token on the master node.

Modify your aws_instance.k3s_master resource like this:

hcl
Copy code
resource "aws_instance" "k3s_master" {
  ami           = "ami-047126e50991d067b" # Replace with Ubuntu AMI
  instance_type = "t2.micro"
  subnet_id     = aws_subnet.private.id
  key_name      = aws_key_pair.deployer_key.key_name
  security_groups = [aws_security_group.k3s_cluster_sg.id]

  tags = {
    Name = "k3s-master"
  }

  user_data = <<-EOF
    #!/bin/bash
    curl -sfL https://get.k3s.io | sh -s - server --node-ip=10.0.2.10
  EOF

  provisioner "remote-exec" {
    inline = [
      "sudo cat /var/lib/rancher/k3s/server/node-token"
    ]

    connection {
      type        = "ssh"
      user        = "ubuntu"
      private_key = file("${path.module}/deployer-key.pem")
      host        = aws_instance.k3s_master.private_ip
    }
  }

  provisioner "local-exec" {
    command = "echo '${aws_instance.k3s_master.private_ip}:6443'"
  }
}
Explanation of the remote-exec Provisioner:
remote-exec: This provisioner SSHs into the instance and runs the command to retrieve the K3S_TOKEN from the master node.
sudo cat /var/lib/rancher/k3s/server/node-token: This retrieves the k3s token.
connection: Specifies the SSH connection details:
type = "ssh": Connect via SSH.
user = "ubuntu": The default user for Ubuntu.
private_key: The private key used to SSH into the master node (deployer-key.pem).
host: The private IP address of the master node.
Add an Output Block to Store the Token:

To capture and display the token as output in Terraform, add this output block:

hcl
Copy code
output "k3s_token" {
  description = "The token for the k3s master node"
  value       = aws_instance.k3s_master.provisioner.remote-exec.result
}

now i want master node Token put into worker node and worker node depends on master node

ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
To ensure the worker nodes use the master node's token and wait for the master node to be ready, you can modify your Terraform configuration to:

Fetch the K3S_TOKEN from the master node using the remote-exec provisioner.
Make the worker nodes depend on the master node and pass the token into the worker nodes.
Here’s how you can do that:

1. Fetch K3S_TOKEN from the Master Node
You’ll modify the master node's aws_instance resource to use the remote-exec provisioner to extract the token from the master and store it in a local_file. Then, you’ll use that token in the worker nodes.

Terraform Code for Master Node
Modify your aws_instance.k3s_master resource as follows:

hcl
Copy code
resource "aws_instance" "k3s_master" {
  ami           = "ami-047126e50991d067b" # Replace with Ubuntu AMI
  instance_type = "t2.micro"
  subnet_id     = aws_subnet.private.id
  key_name      = aws_key_pair.deployer_key.key_name
  security_groups = [aws_security_group.k3s_cluster_sg.id]

  tags = {
    Name = "k3s-master"
  }

  user_data = <<-EOF
    #!/bin/bash
    curl -sfL https://get.k3s.io | sh -s - server --node-ip=10.0.2.10
  EOF

  # Use remote-exec to fetch the K3S token from the master node
  provisioner "remote-exec" {
    inline = [
      "sudo cat /var/lib/rancher/k3s/server/node-token > /tmp/k3s_token.txt"
    ]

    connection {
      type        = "ssh"
      user        = "ubuntu"
      private_key = file("${path.module}/deployer-key.pem")
      host        = self.private_ip
    }
  }

  # Write the token to a local file to use it later in the worker nodes
  provisioner "local-exec" {
    command = "scp -i ${path.module}/deployer-key.pem ubuntu@${self.private_ip}:/tmp/k3s_token.txt ./k3s_token.txt"
  }
}
Explanation of the Changes:
remote-exec provisioner: SSHs into the master node and runs the command to get the token.
sudo cat /var/lib/rancher/k3s/server/node-token > /tmp/k3s_token.txt: This saves the token to a temporary file on the master node.
local-exec provisioner: Copies the token from the master node to your local machine (as k3s_token.txt).
This ensures that the token can be passed to the worker nodes.
2. Modify Worker Nodes to Use the Token and Depend on Master
Next, you need to make the worker nodes wait for the master node to be ready (i.e., the token is retrieved) and then pass the token to the worker nodes using the user_data block.

Terraform Code for Worker Nodes
Modify the aws_instance.k3s_worker resource as follows:

hcl
Copy code
resource "aws_instance" "k3s_worker" {
  count         = 2
  ami           = "ami-047126e50991d067b" # Replace with Ubuntu AMI
  instance_type = "t2.micro"
  subnet_id     = aws_subnet.private.id
  key_name      = aws_key_pair.deployer_key.key_name
  security_groups = [aws_security_group.k3s_cluster_sg.id]

  depends_on = [aws_instance.k3s_master]  # Workers depend on the master node being ready

  tags = {
    Name = "k3s-worker-${count.index + 1}"
  }

  # Read the token from the local file created by the master node
  user_data = <<-EOF
    #!/bin/bash
    K3S_TOKEN=$(cat /tmp/k3s_token.txt)
    curl -sfL https://get.k3s.io | K3S_URL=https://${aws_instance.k3s_master.private_ip}:6443 K3S_TOKEN=${K3S_TOKEN} sh -
  EOF

  provisioner "file" {
    content     = file("${path.module}/k3s_token.txt")
    destination = "/tmp/k3s_token.txt"
  }

  provisioner "remote-exec" {
    inline = [
      "curl -sfL https://get.k3s.io | K3S_URL=https://${aws_instance.k3s_master.private_ip}:6443 K3S_TOKEN=$(cat /tmp/k3s_token.txt) sh -"
    ]

    connection {
      type        = "ssh"
      user        = "ubuntu"
      private_key = file("${path.module}/deployer-key.pem")
      host        = self.private_ip
    }
  }
}
Explanation of the Changes:
depends_on: Ensures the worker nodes only start after the master node has been created.
provisioner "file": Copies the k3s_token.txt (retrieved from the master) to the worker node.
provisioner "remote-exec": SSHs into the worker node and runs the K3S installation using the token to join the worker nodes to the master.
3. Output Block (Optional)
If you want to output the token for any future use or debugging, you can add this to your outputs.tf:

hcl
Copy code
output "k3s_master_token" {
  description = "The K3S token from the master node"
  value       = file("${path.module}/k3s_token.txt")
}
4. Apply the Configuration
Run the following commands to apply your changes:

bash
Copy code
terraform init
terraform apply
Terraform will:

Create the master node and retrieve the K3S token.
Wait for the master node to be ready.
Provision the worker nodes with the token and join them to the k3s cluster.
Summary:
The master node is created first, and the K3S_TOKEN is retrieved.
The worker nodes depend on the master and use the token to join the k3s cluster.
The entire process ensures the worker nodes wait for the master to be ready before joining the cluster.
